CompileFlags:
  Add:
    - -std=c++20
    # FetchContent puts FTXUI here after the first cmake -B build run
    - -Ibuild/_deps/ftxui-src/include
  # Use compile_commands.json from the cmake build directory.
  # This gives clangd the exact compiler invocation (including nix store
  # header paths) so standard library headers like <atomic> are found.
